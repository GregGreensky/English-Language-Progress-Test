I wanted to come back to the UK so I applied for a job as a security officer at Heathrow. It’s our job to keep passengers and staff safe at all times. I meet passengers from all over the world every day and help them with their problems. People are usually friendly, but sometimes they get angry, especially if there are long queues or delays.’</span><h4>Teresa Jones, 30, service manager</h4><span style='font-weight:normal;font-size:17px;'>‘My job is to help passengers have a good journey through the airport terminal, from Arrivals to Departures. I talk to people all day and I’m tired in the evening. But it’s also very exciting, because it changes all the time. One minute you are making new travel arrangements for passengers, and the next minute you are dealing with a problem at passport control. The only bad thing about my job is getting up very early.’</span><h4>Husain Khaled, 35, terminal controller</h4><span style='font-weight:normal;font-size:17px;'>‘My first job at the airport was as a security officer. After that, I did a lot of different jobs here. When I saw a job for a terminal controller, I decided to apply. I like doing this work because there are all kinds of things to deal with – security, communication, safety, and so on. It can be very busy and I spend a lot of time talking to people on my mobile, but it’s always interesting.’</span><br /><br /><span style='font-family:Roboto, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>Example: \t James meets passengers from all over _____.<br /><div class='custom-control custom-radio'><input type='radio' class='custom-control-input' id='ex1' disabled><label id='lblex1' class='custom-control-label' for='ex1' value='a. the UK'>a. the UK</label></div><div class='custom-control custom-radio'><input type='radio' class='custom-control-input' id='ex2' checked disabled><label id='lblex2' class='custom-control-label' for='ex2' value='b. the world'>b. the world</label></div><div class='custom-control custom-radio'><input class='custom-control-input' type='radio' id='ex3' disabled><label id='lblex3' class='custom-control-label' for='ex3' value='c.
