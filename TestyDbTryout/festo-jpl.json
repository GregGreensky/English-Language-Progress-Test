                "content": "<span style='font-weight:normal;'>‘Last year my boyfriend Mark was forty and I wanted to get him a special present for his birthday. Just before Christmas I saw tickets for a Bruce Springsteen concert for sale on the internet. The concert was in Sheffield, about 25 miles away from where we live, and Mark is a big fan of Bruce Springsteen so I decided to buy two tickets. They weren’t cheap – I think I paid around £90 for each one. I wanted to surprise Mark, so I didn’t tell him about it.<br>On the day of the concert, I told Mark that I wanted to do some Christmas shopping in Sheffield. We left in my car just after lunch and spent the afternoon in a big shopping centre. I bought Christmas presents for my family and a skirt for work. Mark looked for some new jeans, but he couldn’t find any that he liked. By the time we finished shopping it was nearly 6 p.m. and we were hungry so we had dinner in a Japanese restaurant. After dinner we left the shopping centre and set off on our way home. On the way we passed the concert hall and we could see the crowds of fans outside. Mark was really surprised when I drove into the concert hall car park and gave him the tickets!<br>The concert was fantastic. We danced all night and Mark took lots of photos on his mobile phone. Afterwards we bought a concert CD. We put it on when we got in the car and we sang all of the songs as we drove home. We didn’t get back home until nearly one o’clock in the morning and we were both really tired, but it was a great night and Mark really enjoyed his surprise.’</span>",
