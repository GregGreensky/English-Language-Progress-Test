I’m better now, but I realised I needed to change my lifestyle. You see, I loved the sun. Every holiday, I went abroad and spent too long in the sun. I didn’t wear sunscreen. I didn’t visit the sights like the other tourists. I wasn’t interested. I just spent my time at the beach. When I go on holiday now, I spend more time at museums and art galleries. It’s safer and more interesting.’</div><br><h4>Vincenzo, age 31</h4><div style='font-weight:normal;'>‘I was a doctor and I loved my job. But I did too much work. And that’s unhealthy. I had no time for my family or friends. I wasn’t getting enough sleep and I wasn’t doing enough exercise. I felt irritable and stressed. I needed to slow down and change my lifestyle. So I decided to work four days a week, not seven! Now I spend much more time with my children. I sleep better and I do more sport. I have slowed down and I feel happier.’</div><br><h4>Clare, age 24</h4><div style='font-weight:normal;'>‘I work in a department store in the capital city. This city has the best restaurants I’ve ever been to. It has the best-dressed people I’ve ever seen. And it has the most expensive shops. So, although I like my job, I don’t have enough money to live here! Before, I spent too much money on things I didn’t really need. I’ve changed my habits now. I try to eat at home, not in restaurants. I don’t try to look like the people who come into the department store. And I don’t go into the expensive shops. I’m much less frustrated now!’</div>",
