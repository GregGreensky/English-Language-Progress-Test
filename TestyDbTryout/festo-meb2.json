I hope so, because if you are, you’ll live longer and you’ll be healthier. Or are you a pessimist? I hope not. Studies show that you won’t enjoy life as much and you’ll take longer to get better when you’re ill. So how do you think positive, not negative, thoughts? Here are some tips on how to be a positive thinker.</p><p><b>Stop thinking negative thoughts</b> such as ‘I’ll never find a partner’ or ‘I’ll never pass my driving test’. Find something positive to do. Phone your best friend and have a chat. Go out and do some exercise. Put on a funny DVD. This will stop you thinking negative thoughts, and will cheer you up.</p><p><b>Don’t compare your life with other people’s lives.</b> For example, thoughts like ‘She’s got a better job’ or ‘He’s got a bigger house’ make you feel pessimistic about life. Change your thinking to ‘I’ve got a good job and I like my work’ and ‘I’m happy in this house. It’s big enough for me’. Remember, being successful doesn’t always mean you are happy. </p><p><b>Write down your negative thoughts.</b> This will help you to clear those thoughts from your head. And that will make you feel more positive. You could also write down positive things that happened to you. Read them when you are feeling sad or depressed, and that will make you feel more positive.</p><p><b> Use positive language when you speak.</b> This will make you think more positively. For example, don’t say ‘Our holiday was a disaster’. Say ‘Next holiday, we’re going to do things differently’. Don’t say ‘Famous? It’ll never happen’. Say ‘Famous? I’ll try my best’. Try it – it works! <br /><br /> <br><span class='sub-pyt' style='font-family:Roboto; font-size:18px;'>According to Dr Charles, ...</span>",
